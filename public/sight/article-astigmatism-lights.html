            <p>
                Have you ever driven at night and noticed that street lamps and car headlights appear to have long,
                streaky rays of light coming off them? This phenomenon, often referred to as <span
                    class="highlight">astigmatism lights</span>, is a classic symptom of a common refractive error.
                While many people think they just have "blurry eyes," a professional <span class="highlight">astigmatism
                    test</span> often reveals that the shape of their eye is preventing light from focusing properly.
            </p>

            <h2 id="what-is">Astigmatism vs Normal: What Causes Astigmatism?</h2>
            <p>
                In a perfect world, our eyes would be shaped like perfectly round basketballs. This is what we call
                "normal" vision. However, for many, the cornea or lens is curved more in one direction than the
                other—shaped more like a football. When comparing <span class="highlight">astigmatism vs normal</span>,
                the key difference is how light behaves as it enters the eye. In a normal eye, light converges onto a
                single point on the retina. In an eye with astigmatism, light is focused on multiple points, leading to
                distortion.
            </p>
            <p>
                But <span class="highlight">what causes astigmatism</span> in the first place? Most cases are
                hereditary; you are simply born with an eye shape that isn't perfectly spherical. Other times, it can
                develop after an eye injury or surgery. It is a common misconception that reading in low light or
                sitting too close to the TV causes it. While those habits cause eye strain, they do not change the
                physical curvature of your cornea.
            </p>

            <h2 id="stigmatism">Stigmatism vs Astigmatism: Clearing the Confusion</h2>
            <p>
                Oftentimes, you'll hear people use the term <span class="highlight">stigmatism</span>. In reality, <span
                    class="highlight">stigmatism vs astigmatism</span> isn't a comparison between two different
                conditions. "Stigmatism" is usually just a mispronunciation of "astigmatism." In medical terms, "stigma"
                means a point; "a-stigmatism" literally means "without a point," referring to the lack of a single focal
                point for light. If you tell your doctor you have <span class="highlight">stigmatism</span>, they will
                know you mean astigmatism, but using the correct term helps you better understand the science behind
                your vision.
            </p>

            <h2 id="correction">Corrective Options: Astigmatism Glasses and Contacts</h2>
            <p>
                The good news is that correcting this condition is easier than ever. Most people start with <span
                    class="highlight">astigmatism glasses</span>. These lenses have a special "cylindrical" power that
                compensates for the uneven curvature of your eye. When shopping for <span class="highlight">astigmatism
                    glasses</span>, ensure your prescription includes the "Cylinder" and "Axis" values, as these are the
                precise measurements of your eye's distortion.
            </p>
            <p>
                For those who prefer a frame-free look, <span class="highlight">contact lenses for
                    astigmatism</span>—also known as toric lenses—are highly effective. Unlike regular contacts, <span
                    class="highlight">contact lenses for astigmatism</span> are weighted at the bottom to ensure they
                stay in a specific orientation on your eye. If a toric lens rotates, your vision will become blurry
                again. This is why a proper fitting by an eye care professional is essential.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, you can even find <span class="highlight">colored contacts for astigmatism</span>. In the
                past, people with astigmatism were limited to clear lenses, but modern manufacturing now allows for
                vibrant <span class="highlight">colored contacts for astigmatism</span> that provide both clear vision
                and a new look.
            </p>

            <h2 id="lasik">Beyond Lenses: Can LASIK Fix Astigmatism?</h2>
            <p>
                A frequently asked question for those tired of maintaining lenses is: <span class="highlight">can lasik
                    fix astigmatism</span>? The answer is a resounding yes. LASIK (Laser-Assisted in Situ
                Keratomileusis) uses a cold laser to reshape the cornea. By removing microscopic amounts of tissue, the
                surgeon can make the cornea more spherical, effectively "curing" the astigmatism for most patients.
                While not everyone is a candidate, <span class="highlight">can lasik fix astigmatism</span> is usually
                the first question discussed during a refractive surgery consultation.
            </p>

            <h2 id="test">Take an Astigmatism Test</h2>
            <p>
                If you aren't sure if you have it, you can look for an <span class="highlight">astigmatism test</span>
                online or via mobile apps. A common test involves a series of radial lines in a circle. If some lines
                look darker or thicker than others while you are at a distance, it's a strong indicator that you should
                visit a professional for a comprehensive <span class="highlight">astigmatism test</span>.

                ruining your night vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take the first step today by performing an <span class="highlight">astigmatism test</span> and
